  Provides a mechanism for communicating desired
  program properties to the underlying solver.  Rosette keeps track of all
  assertions evaluated during an execution in an @tech{assertion store}. 
  If @racket[expr] evaluates to @racket[#f], an error is thrown using the 
  optional failure message, and @racket[#f] is added to the assertion store.  The error message
  can be either a string or a no-argument procedure that throws an error when called.
  If @racket[expr] evaluates to a symbolic boolean value, that value is added to the assertion store.
  If @racket[expr] evaluates to any other value, @racket[assert] has no effect.  The contents
  of the assertion store can be examined using the @racket[asserts] procedure, and they can be
  cleared using the @racket[clear-asserts!] procedure.

@defform[(solve expr)]{
  Searches for a binding of symbolic constants to concrete values that satisfies all assertions encountered
  before the invocation of @racket[solve] and during the evaluation of @racket[expr]. 
  If such a binding exists, it is returned in the form of a satisfiable @racket[solution?]; otherwise, 
  the result is an unsatisfiable solution.  The assertions encountered while 
  evaluating @racket[expr] are removed from the global @tech["assertion store"] once @racket[solve] returns.  As a result, 
  @racket[solve] has no observable effect on the @tech["assertion store"]. 
  The solver's ability to find solutions depends on the current @tech["reasoning precision"], as
  determined by the @racket[current-bitwidth] parameter.

@defproc[(solve+) procedure?]{
Returns a stateful procedure that uses a fresh @racket[solver?] instance
to incrementally solve a sequence of constraints (with respect to @racket[current-bitwidth]).

The returned procedure consumes a constraint (i.e., a boolean value or @tech["symbolic term"]),
a positive integer, or the symbol @racket['shutdown].

If the argument is a constraint, it is pushed onto the solver's constraint stack and
a solution for all constraints on the stack is returned.

If the argument is a positive integer @var[k], then the top @var[k] constraints are popped
from the solver's constraint stack and the result is the solution to the remaining constraints.

If the argument is @racket['shutdown], all resources used by the procedure are released, and any
subsequent calls to the procedure throw an exception.

  Searches for a binding of symbolic constants to concrete values that satisfies all assertions encountered
  before the invocation of @racket[optimize] and during the evaluation of @racket[minimize-expr],
  @racket[maximize-expr], and @racket[guarantee-expr].  
  If such a binding exists, it is returned in the form of a satisfiable @racket[solution?]; otherwise, 
  the result is an unsatisfiable solution.  Any satisfiable solution returned by @racket[optimize] is optimal with respect
  to the cost terms provided in the @racket[minimize-expr] and @racket[maximize-expr] lists.  Specifically, these
  terms take on the minimum or maximum values when evaluated with respect to a satisfiable solution.  For more details on
  solving optimization problems, see the
  @hyperlink["https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/optimization"]{Z3 optimization tutorial}.

  As is the case for other solver-aided queries, the assertions encountered while 
  evaluating @racket[minimize-expr],
  @racket[maximize-expr], and @racket[guarantee-expr] are removed from the global @tech["assertion store"] once
  the query returns.  As a result, 
  @racket[optimize] has no observable effect on the @tech["assertion store"]. 
  The solver's ability to find solutions (as well as their optimality) depends on the current @tech["reasoning precision"],
  as determined by the @racket[current-bitwidth] parameter.

@section{Debugging}

@defmodule[rosette/query/debug #:use-sources (rosette/query/debug)]

@defform[(define/debug head body ...)
         #:grammar
         ([head id (id ...)])]{
  Defines a procedure or an expression, and marks it as a candidate for debugging.  
  When a @racket[debug] query is applied to a failing execution, 
  forms that are not marked in this way are considered 
  correct.  The solver will apply the debugging algorithm only to 
  expressions and procedures marked as potentially faulty using 
  @racket[define/debug].
}

@defform[(debug [type ...+] expr)
         #:contracts
         ([type (and/c solvable? type? (not/c function?))])]{
Searches for a minimal set of @racket[define/debug] expressions of 
the given @tech["solvable type"](s) that are collectively responsible for the observed failure of @racket[expr]. 
If no expressions of the specified types are relevent to the failure, an error is thrown.  The 
returned expressions, if any, are called a minimal unsatisfiable core. The core expressions 
are relevant to the observed failure in that preventing the failure requries modifying at least one 
core expression. In particular, if all of the non-core expressions were replaced with 
fresh constants created using @racket[define-symbolic*], @racket[(solve expr)] would still fail.  It 
can only execute successfully if at least one of the core expressions is also
replaced with a fresh constant. See the @seclink["ch:essentials"]{Essentials} chapter for example uses of
the @racket[debug] form.}

@section[#:tag "sec:reasoning-precision"]{Reasoning Precision}

@defparam[current-bitwidth k (or/c #f positive-integer?)
          #:value 5]{
  A parameter that defines the current @deftech[#:key "reasoning precision"]{reasoning precision}
  for solver-aided queries over @racket[integer?] and @racket[real?] constants.
  Setting @racket[current-bitwidth] to a positive integer @racket[k] instructs Rosette to approximate
  both reals and integers with signed @racket[k]-bit words. Setting it to @racket[#f] instructs Rosette to use
  infinite precision for real and integer operations.  As a general rule, @racket[current-bitwidth] should
  be set once, before any numeric operations are evaluated. 

  Technically, when @racket[current-bitwidth] is a positive integer @racket[k],
  Rosette translates queries over reals and integers into constraints in the 
  @hyperlink["http://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial"]{theory of bitvectors}
  (of size @racket[k]), which can be efficiently decided by SMT solvers.
  When this form of translation is used, a @racket[solve] or @racket[verify]
  query will produce a satisfiable result if and only if there is a
  solution under @racket[k]-bit semantics that is also correct under infinite-precision semantics.
  (Note that this guarantee is limited in the case of unsatisfiability---it says only
   that no @racket[k]-bit solution corresponds to an infinite-precision solution.)
  Rosette does not provide such a soundness guarantee for other queries because it is 
  computationally expensive or impossible to provide.  A @racket[synthesize] query, for example, 
  may produce a solution that is correct under @racket[k]-bit semantics, but incorrect under
  infinite-precision semantics. 

  When  @racket[current-bitwidth] is @racket[#f], Rosette translates queries over
  reals and integers into constraints in the
  @hyperlink["http://rise4fun.com/z3/tutorial"]{theories of reals and integers}. 
  These theories are effectively decidable only for linear constraints,
  so most applications will perform better when @racket[current-bitwidth] is
  set to a positive integer.

  The @racket[current-bitwidth] parameter must be set to @racket[#f] when
  executing queries over assertions that contain @tech[#:key "quantified formula"]{quantified formulas}
  or @seclink["sec:UF"]{uninterpreted functions}.
  Otherwise, such a query will throw an exception.
