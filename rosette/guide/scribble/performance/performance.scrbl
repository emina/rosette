@title[#:tag "ch:performance"]{Performance}

Rosette provides an efficient, general-purpose runtime for solver-aided programming.
But as with any other form of programming, 
scaling this runtime to challenging problems involves careful design,
and sometimes requires changes to code to better suit Rosette's
symbolic virtual machine (SVM) style of execution.
This chapter describes common performance problems and solutions,
as well as tools built into Rosette for diagnosing these problems.

@section[#:tag "sec:antipatterns"]{Common Performance Issues}

When a Rosette program performs poorly,
it is often due to one of four common issues, described next.

@subsection{Integer and Real Theories}

Rosette supports assertions containing symbolic values of integer or real type.
But satisfiability solving with these types is expensive (or, in the worst case, undecidable),
and even simple queries can be unacceptably slow.

One solution to performance issues with assertions involving integers or reals
is Rosette's @racket[current-bitwidth] parameter,
which controls the @tech{reasoning precision} used for queries.
When @racket[current-bitwidth] is set to a value @emph{k} other than @racket[#f],
Rosette approximates @racket[integer?] and @racket[real?] values using signed @emph{k}-bit @racket[bitvector]s.
This approximation can make assertions involving integers and reals
more efficiently decidable.

But this approximation is unsound and may produce results that are 
incorrect under the infinite-precision semantics of integers and reals
(while being correct under the finite-precision semantics).
For example, this program incorrectly says that no integer greater than 15 exists,
because the setting of @racket[current-bitwidth] causes it to consider only values of @racket{x}
that can be represented as a 5-bit bitvector.

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(current-bitwidth 5)
(define-symbolic x integer?)
(solve (assert (> x 15)))]

So, choosing the right reasoning precision for an application involves navigating this tradeoff
between performance and soundness. 

@subsection{Algorithmic Mismatch}

Small algorithmic changes can have a large impact on the efficiency
of the symbolic evaluation performed by the Rosette SVM.
Often, the most efficient algorithm for symbolic inputs
is different to the most efficient one for concrete inputs---an
@deftech{algorithmic mismatch}.

For example,
consider this function to set the @tt{idx}th element of a list @tt{lst} to @tt{val}:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define (list-set lst idx val)
  (let-values ([(front back) (split-at lst idx)])
    (append front (cons val (cdr back)))))
(list-set '(a b c) 1 'd)
]

While appropriate for concrete inputs,
this function exhibits poor performance when the
inputs are symbolic:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define-symbolic* idx len integer?)
(define lst (take '(a b c) len))
(code:line (list-set lst idx 'd) (code:comment "symbolic union with 6 parts"))
]

The root cause is the @racket[split-at] operation,
which separates the front and back of the list
into different variables.
Because the index @racket[idx] to split at is symbolic,
the Rosette SVM creates two @tech{symbolic unions} to capture
the possible front and back values
as a function of @racket[idx].
Even though the possible values of @racket[front] and @racket[back]
are related, this separation loses the relationship.

A better implementation for symbolic inputs
avoids splitting the list by iterating over it,
updating each position depending on whether its index is equal to @tt{idx}:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define (list-set* lst idx val)
  (for/all ([lst lst])
    (map (lambda (i v) (if (= idx i) val v))
         (build-list (length lst) identity)
         lst)))
(list-set* '(a b c) 1 'd)
(code:line (list-set* lst idx 'd) (code:comment "smaller symbolic union with 4 parts"))
]

@subsection{Irregular Representation}

Just as the best algorithm for symbolic inputs can differ
from that for concrete inputs (an @tech{algorithmic mismatch}),
so can the best data structure.
Programming with symbolic values is most efficient
when data structures are regular;
even though an @deftech{irregular representation} may be more space efficient for concrete data,
it can have negative performance impacts when the data is symbolic.

For example, consider representing a (mutable) 2D grid data structure
using Rosette's lifted support for @tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{vectors}.
The obvious representation is to use nested vectors to represent the two dimensions:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define-values (width height) (values 5 5))
(define-symbolic* x y integer?)
(define grid/2d
  (for/vector ([_ height])
    (make-vector width #f)))
(vector-set! (vector-ref grid/2d y) x 'a)
]

This representation is inefficient when indexed with symbolic values,
because the dereferences are irregular:
the dereference of the @racket[y]-coordinate returns a vector,
whereas the dereference of the @racket[x]-coordinate returns a value.
This irregularity requires Rosette to perform more symbolic evaluation work
to faithfully track the usages of the nested vector.

An alternative representation stores the entire grid in one vector,
indexed using simple arithmetic:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define grid/flat
  (make-vector (* width height) #f))
(vector-set! grid/flat (+ (* y width) x) 'a)
]

This variant improves performance by about 2Ã—.

@subsection{Missed Concretization}

In addition to employing careful algorithmic and representational choices,
fast solver-aided code provides as much information as possible
about the feasible choices of symbolic values.
Failure to make this information explicit
results in @deftech{missed concretization} opportunities, and 
these misses can cause significant performance degradation.

For example, consider the following toy procedure,
that returns the @racket[idx]th element of the list @racket[lst],
but only if @racket[idx] is 0 or 1:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define (maybe-ref lst idx)
  (if (<= 0 idx 1)
      (list-ref lst idx)
      -1))
(define-symbolic* idx integer?)
(maybe-ref '(5 6 7) idx)
]

This procedure has poor performance when given a symbolic index @racket[idx],
because the call to @racket[(list-ref lst idx)]
passes a symbolic index,
but the conditional establishes that the only possible values for that index are 0 or 1.
When the Rosette SVM evaluates the first side of the conditional,
it does not simplify the value of @racket[idx] to be only 0 or 1,
and so the resulting encoding creates infeasible branches
for cases where @racket[idx] is outside that range.
An alternative version captures that concreteness:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define (maybe-ref* lst idx)
  (cond [(= idx 0) (list-ref lst 0)]
        [(= idx 1) (list-ref lst 1)]
        [else -1]))
(maybe-ref* '(5 6 7) idx)
]

This variant avoids generating infeasible return values
for the cases where @racket[idx] is greater than 1.

@section[#:tag "sec:sympro"]{Symbolic Profiling}

Rosette includes a @deftech[#:key "symbolic profiler"]{symbolic profiler}
for diagnosing performance issues in solver-aided programs.
The symbolic profiler instruments key metrics in the Rosette SVM
and relates them to the performance of a Rosette program,
suggesting the locations of potential bottlenecks---that is, parts of
the program that are difficult to evaluate symbolically.
More details about symbolic profiling are available
in the related technical paper @~cite[sympro:oopsla18].

To run the symbolic profiler on a program file @nonterm{prog},
use the @exec{raco} command:

@commandline{raco symprofile @nonterm{prog}}

After executing @nonterm{prog},
the symbolic profiler produces a browser-based output summarizing the results,
similar to this output:

@(image profile.png #:scale 0.7)

The top half of this output visualizes the evolution of the Racket call stack
over time.
Each procedure call is a rectangle in this chart,
with its width corresponding to the total time taken by the call.
Blue highlighted regions reflect @tech{solver} activity
generated by Rosette @seclink["sec:queries"]{queries}.

The bottom half summarizes important metrics about the SVM on a per-procedure basis.
Each procedure invoked by the program has a row in the table,
with columns that measure:

@itemlist[
 @item{The total @bold{time} taken by all invocations of the procedure.}
 @item{The @bold{term count}, the total number of @tech[#:key "symbolic term"]{symbolic terms} created by the procedure.}
 @item{The number of @bold{unused terms}, which are terms created but never sent to a solver.}
 @item{The @bold{union size}, counting the total size of all @tech[#:key "symbolic unions"]{symbolic unions} created by the procedure.}
 @item{The @bold{merge count}, summing the number of execution paths merged by the SVM within the procedure.}
 ]

Procedures are ranked by a @bold{score}, which summarizes the other data in the table.
Procedures with higher scores are more likely to be bottlenecks,
and should be investigated first for performance issues.


@subsection[#:tag "sec:sympro:opts"]{Options and Caveats}

By default, the symbolic profiler instruments only code that is within
a module whose initial module path is either @tt{rosette} or @tt{rosette/safe}.
In other words, only files beginning with @tt{#lang rosette} or @tt{#lang rosette/safe} will be instrumented.
To instrument @emph{all} code, use the @DFlag{racket} flag described below.

Similarly, by default, the symbolic profiler instruments only code that
does not belong to installed packages. To instrument
given installed packages, use the @DFlag{pkg} flag described below.

The @exec{raco symprofile @nonterm{prog}} command accepts the following command-line flags:

@itemlist[
 @item{@DFlag{stream} --- stream profile data to a browser while executing
   the program, rather than producing output only once the program completes.
   This option is useful for programs that do not terminate, or take a very long
   time to run.}

 @item{@Flag{d} @nonterm{delay} --- delay between samples when using the @DFlag{stream} option,
   in seconds (defaults to 2 s).}

 @item{@Flag{m} @nonterm{module-name} --- run the specified @nonterm{module-name}
   submodule of @nonterm{prog} (defaults to the @tt{main} submodule).}

 @item{@Flag{t} @nonterm{threshold} --- prune function calls whose execution time is less
   than @nonterm{threshold} milliseconds (defaults to 1 ms).}

 @item{@DFlag{racket} --- instrument code in any language, not just those
   derived from Rosette.}

 @item{@DFlag{pkg} @nonterm{pkg-name} --- instrument code in @nonterm{pkg-name}.}
  ]




@section{Walkthrough: Debugging Rosette Performance}

To illustrate a typical Rosette performance debugging process,
consider building a small solver-aided program
for verifying optimizations in a toy calculator language.
First, we define the calculator language,
in which programs are lists of operations,
and specify its semantics
with a simple recursive interpreter:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(code:comment "Calculator opcodes.")
(define-values (Add Sub Sqr Nop)
  (values (bv 0 2) (bv 1 2) (bv 2 2) (bv 3 2)))

(code:comment "An interpreter for calculator programs.")
(code:comment "A program is a list of '(op) or '(op arg) instructions")
(code:comment "that update acc, where op is a 2-bit opcode and arg is")
(code:comment "a 4-bit constant.")
(define (calculate prog [acc (bv 0 4)])
  (cond                      ; An interpreter for 
    [(null? prog) acc]       ; calculator programs.
    [else                    ; A program is list of 
     (define ins (car prog)) ; '(op) or '(op arg)
     (define op (car ins))   ; instructions that up-
     (calculate              ; date acc, where op is 
      (cdr prog)             ; a 2-bit opcode and arg
      (cond                  ; is a 4-bit constant.
        [(eq? op Add) (bvadd acc (cadr ins))]
        [(eq? op Sub) (bvsub acc (cadr ins))]
        [(eq? op Sqr) (bvmul acc acc)]
        [else         acc]))]))]

One potential optimization for programs in this language
is to replace subtractions with additions.
The @tt{sub->add} procedure performs this operation
at a given index in a program:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(code:comment "Functionally sets lst[idx] to val.")
(define (list-set lst idx val) ; Functionally sets
  (match lst                   ; lst[idx] to val.
    [(cons x xs)
     (if (= idx 0) 
         (cons val xs)
         (cons x (list-set xs (- idx 1) val)))]
    [_ lst]))

(code:comment "Replaces Sub with Add if possible.")
(define (sub->add prog idx)        ; Replaces Sub with 
  (define ins (list-ref prog idx)) ; Add if possible.
  (if (eq? (car ins) Sub)          
      (list-set prog idx (list Add (bvneg (cadr ins))))
      prog))]

To check that this optimization is correct,
we implement a tiny verification tool @tt{verify-xform}
that constructs a symbolic calculator program of size @tt{N},
applies the optimization,
and checks that the original and optimized programs
produce the same outputs:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(code:comment "Verifies the given transform for all programs of length N.")
(define (verify-xform xform N) ; Verifies the given
  (define P                    ; transform for all 
    (for/list ([i N])          ; programs of length N.
      (define-symbolic* op (bitvector 2))   
      (define-symbolic* arg (bitvector 4))
      (if (eq? op Sqr) (list op) (list op arg))))
  (define-symbolic* acc (bitvector 4))
  (define-symbolic* idx integer?)
  (define xP (xform P idx))
  (verify ; âˆ€ acc, idx, P. P(acc) = xform(P, idx)(acc)
   (assert (eq? (calculate P acc) (calculate xP acc)))))
]

We can verify @tt{sub->add} for all calculator programs of size 5:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(verify-xform sub->add 5)
]

which produces no counterexamples, as expected.

@(rosette-eval '(clear-asserts!))
@(rosette-eval '(clear-terms!))
@subsection{Performance Bottlenecks}

Verifying @tt{sub->add} for larger values of @tt{N}
causes the performance of @tt{verify-xform} to degrade,
from less than a second when @tt{N} = 5 to
a dozen seconds when @tt{N} = 20.
To identify the source of this performance issue,
we can invoke the @tech{symbolic profiler} on the verifier,
producing the output below (after selecting the "Collapse solver time" checkbox):

@(image profile-xform.png #:scale 0.7)

The symbolic profiler identifies @tt{list-set} as the bottleneck in this program.
The output shows that @tt{list-set} creates many symbolic terms,
and performs many symbolic operations (the "Union Size" and "Merge Count" columns).

The core issue here is an @tech{algorithmic mismatch}:
@tt{list-set} makes a recursive call guarded by a short-circuiting condition
@racket[(= idx 0)] that is symbolic when @racket[idx] is unknown.
When a condition's truth value is unknown,
the Rosette SVM must execute both branches of the conditional,
and then merge the two resulting values together
under @tech{path conditions} that summarize the branching decisions
required to reach each value.
In this example, this @emph{symbolic execution}
therefore always executes the recursive call,
and each call creates a larger path condition,
since it must summarize all the previous recursive calls.
This behavior leads to a quadratic growth in the symbolic representation of the list
returned by @tt{list-set}:
@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define-symbolic* idx integer?)
(list-set '(1 2 3) idx 4)]

The solution is to alter @tt{list-set} to recurse unconditionally:

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(define (list-set* lst idx val)
  (match lst
    [(cons x xs)
     (cons (if (= idx 0) val x)
           (list-set* xs (- idx 1) val))]
    [_ lst]))]

In this revision, the SVM still evaluates both branches
of the conditional, but neither side of the conditional recurses,
and so the path conditions no longer grow quadratically.

@interaction[#:eval rosette-eval
(list-set* '(1 2 3) idx 4)]

The performance of @tt{verify-xform} after this change
improves by 2Ã— for @tt{N} = 20.
