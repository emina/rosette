Chapters @seclink["ch:getting-started"]{1}-@seclink["ch:programmer-defined-datatypes"]{5} introduce the basic constructs and datatypes for programming in Rosette. This chapter describes the parts of the core Racket libraries (e.g., I/O procedures) that are exported by @racketmodname[rosette/safe], as well as Rosette libraries that provide additional facilities for solver-aided development.
