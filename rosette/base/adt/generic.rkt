(provide adt-type-cast)

; This macro takes the form:
; * (adt-type-cast value #:type racket-type? #:lifted symbolic-type? #:caller caller)  
; The form expands into an expression that casts the given 
; value to the type specified by the primitive Racket 
; predicate and its corresponding lifted Rosette type?.  The cast 
; asserts a @boolean? that is true iff the cast is valid,  
; and it returns the result of casting the input value to symbolic-type?.   
; This macro assumes that the only possible non-concrete value of 
; such a type is a symbolic union.
