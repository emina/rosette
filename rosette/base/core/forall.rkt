; This macro is equivalent to a nested use of 
; for/all.  For example, 
; (for*/all ([v0 val0] [v1 val1]) expr)
; is equivalent to 
; (for/all ([v0 val0])
;  (for/all ([v1 val1])
;    expr))

; This macro takes the following form:
; (for/all ([v val]) expr)
; where v is an identifier that can be used in expr,
; and val is a Rosette value.  If the provided value 
; is a symbolic reference, the macro evaluates the 
; expression for all possible v's to which that 
; symbolic reference could point.  If the provided 
; value is not a symbolic reference, then the expression 
; is simply evaluated with v bound to the value itself.

; of this procedure is the result of this evaluation process.  
; The guard-apply procedure also merges any state updates resulting 
; from successful guarded evaluations of proc on the given values.  
;
; All given guards are required to be pairwise mutually exclusive, 
; and at least one of the guards must always evaluate to true.
